Introduction IA Capstone project : Breast cancer recognition

## How to use 
For now, only the Jupyter notebook works, to use it, go on Google Colab :
- [Basic code](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1xUcraEoNFe4d6pY7HtMHLvwW6L4YAY8j?usp=sharing) 

Then, in execution, change execution type to a GPU one.

- Python 3
<!-- - Launch the ./setup.sh file -->
- [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aryashah2k/breast-ultrasound-images-dataset)

## Sources
- [Attention based UNet model for breast cancer segmentation using BUSI dataset](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-72712-5)
